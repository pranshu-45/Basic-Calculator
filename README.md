# Basic-Calculators
Calculator built in kotlin

Basic functions-add,subtract,multiply,division\
Played around with strings,associated properties and functions\
Built the UI with linear layouts\
Using onClick() method for buttons directly from the UI\
Adding and modifying string items in colors.xml,strings.xml and themes.xml, rather than hardcoding values\\

Challenges\
handled restricting input of multiple operators simultaneously allowing first number as negative\
allowed entry of decimal values for both the operands\\

Limitations\
calculations limited to data types double\
second operand can't be negative\
on pressing clear, display string resets to "" rather than "0"
